# BRIA Background Removal v2.0 Model Card

RMBG v2.0 is our new state-of-the-art background removal model significantly improves RMBG v1.4. The model is designed to effectively separate foreground from background in a range of
categories and image types. This model has been trained on a carefully selected dataset, which includes:
general stock images, e-commerce, gaming, and advertising content, making it suitable for commercial use cases powering enterprise content creation at scale. 
The accuracy, efficiency, and versatility currently rival leading source-available models. 
It is ideal where content safety, legally licensed datasets, and bias mitigation are paramount. 

Developed by BRIA AI, RMBG v2.0 is available as a source-available model for non-commercial use.

## Training data
Bria-RMBG model was trained with over 15,000 high-quality, high-resolution, manually labeled (pixel-wise accuracy), fully licensed images.
Our benchmark included balanced gender, balanced ethnicity, and people with different types of disabilities.
For clarity, we provide our data distribution according to different categories, demonstrating our model’s versatility.

### Distribution of images:

| Category | Distribution |
| -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:|
| Objects only | 45.11% |
| People with objects/animals | 25.24% |
| People only | 17.35% |
| people/objects/animals with text | 8.52% |
| Text only | 2.52% |
| Animals only | 1.89% |

| Category | Distribution |
| -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------------:|
| Photorealistic | 87.70% |
| Non-Photorealistic | 12.30% |


| Category | Distribution |
| -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:|
| Non Solid Background | 52.05% |
| Solid Background | 47.95% 


| Category | Distribution |
| -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------:|
| Single main foreground object | 51.42% |
| Multiple objects in the foreground | 48.58% |

### Usage

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->


```python
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
from transformers import AutoModelForImageSegmentation

model = AutoModelForImageSegmentation.from_pretrained('briaai/RMBG-2.0', trust_remote_code=True)
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(['high', 'highest'][0])
model.to('cuda')
model.eval()

# Data settings
image_size = (1024, 1024)
transform_image = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(image_size),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

image = Image.open(input_image_path)
input_images = transform_image(image).unsqueeze(0).to('cuda')

# Prediction
with torch.no_grad():
    preds = model(input_images)[-1].sigmoid().cpu()
pred = preds[0].squeeze()
pred_pil = transforms.ToPILImage()(pred)
mask = pred_pil.resize(image.size)
image.putalpha(mask)

image.save("no_bg_image.png")
```
